It exceeds the aims of COMP9900 in doing more than ""putting everything together"": it aims at letting students tackle a genuine piece of research and improve on the state of the art, be it by making an algorithm more effective, or combining algorithms in new ways, or applying and adjusting particular techniques to new problems. Though projects can be purely theoretical, most projects will be applied at least to some extent and they will have an experimental component, thanks to which it is often possible to compare the proposed approach with existing ones.

Unless they scored at least 85 in COMP9991, they do not have the option to select COMP9993. Also, rather than following up with COMP9992, they can instead enrol in COMP9990, would they wish so, or would they have to in case they scored less than 75 in COMP9991. The supervisor will make sure that the project is possibly restricted so it is equivalent to completing 1 standard course, in particular in the case of a student who is eligible to enrol in COMP9993 but who prefers to follow up with COMP9992.
